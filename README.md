# Mac-Cleaner

A completely free Mac app that clears caches and downloads on your disk. It is not a RAM cleaner, unlike what the icon says. It is made with Automator, although it says it was made by Shortcuts due to Automator being based on Shortcuts since macOS 14 (Sonoma).

Latest Version: 1.1

Download it here:

To download older releases, visit the Releases page.

Requirements: macOS 13 (Ventura) or later

To install:

1. Download the disk image.
2. Mount the image and launch the installer in the disk image. You may need to give the installer permissions and enter your admin password a few times. When a Preview window opens showing "Installation complete." on a white background, you will know that the app is now in the Applications folder. (Note: Do not hide or trash the folder in your Documents folder called "Important Caches". Those are cache files that are important. The cleaner copies these files back to the "Caches" folder to ensure that Find My, Maps, and Weather work properly). MacOS 14 (Sonoma) users: Home now also uses these caches.
3. Enable Full Disk access for the app "Mac Cleaner" (in your Applications folder) in System Settings by adding it to the list and then making sure that the toggle is on (this is so that the cleaner can access all of those trashy files on your disk).

To use:

1. Go to the Launchpad and click on the app.
2. Empty your trash

To update:
1. Go through install steps 1-2.
Note: You won't need to update permissions in System Settings. The installer automatically merges the new version of the app with the older one.
